# Weather_Dashboard

## Description

For this project, I created a Weather Dashboard that provides current weather and a five-day forecast for any city. I used OpenWeather's APIs to call and retrieve weather data. Weather cards for each day are generated entirely with JavaScript. I utilized local storage to save and create buttons for searched cities.

I ran out of time styling the page, so please excuse the crude design!
